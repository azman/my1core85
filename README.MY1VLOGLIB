My personal collection (library?) of reusable Verilog HDL codes. Also included
are two bash shell scripts that can be used to run either Modelsim's Verilog
simulator (testvlog.sh) or Icarus Verilog simulator (testvlog_i.sh).

Module Notes:

- decoder
  = using generate statements to automate assignments
  = took me a while but i figured it out (have to use >2-input gate)

ModelSim Notes:

- to start working, create a work library
  = command: vlib <lib-name>
  = <lib-name> is usually work
- to compile Verilog source
  = command: vlog <source-file>
  = wildcards acceptable e.g. vlog register*
- to run simulation without waveform viewer
  = command: vsim -c <lib-name>.module
  = add '-do "run -all"' to skip simulation prompt

Feel free to use the code(s) available here at your own risk :)
