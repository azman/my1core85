- serial facility done (just connect the lines?)
  = not tested (need confirmation from actual board)
- interrupt facility completed
  = trap not 'activated' for now...
  = intr not done... but just a matter of running inta cycle!
- Not implemented... yet
  = hold acknowledge (need to clarify when to do that ? cycles after ?)

Note:

- need a more efficient overall test method :p
